# lets-travel

In this project for front-en development I use HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap,

for middelware and backend database I used Node, Express and MongoDB.  

I add the admin page and with the help of it we're going to add new posts the lead them

update them and so on and so forth when we click on admin page we need to pass authorization if we are

already a registered user we fill in the form with our email and password.

If we are a new user we have to register.

Suppose we are a registered user with the email admin at  dot com.

We fill in the form with our email and password.

Then we click the button sign in and we are redirected to the admin page.

The admin page is composed of three tabs the first tab is called articles.

Here we see all the posts on landmarks.

Also we can add new post by filling in the title of a new post.

For example the Taj Mahal.

Then comes the country.

There are two ways to add the image of the landmark either by adding it's your URL or by choosing the

file from the computer.

Finally we add the text of the post and click on the button create post as a result.

The post was added to the list of articles in addition to this the post on the Taj Mahal has been added

to the main page of the Web site.

We can click on details and see the image and the text about this wonderful landmark we see the title

Taj Mahal the image and of course the text of the post and we see where it is beautiful temple is located

on the map.

In addition to this we can edit posts by clicking on the edit button.

Also there is the possibility to delete the post just by clicking on the sign which is there Remove

button.

The second tab is called males in this tab.

We're going to see all requests sent from this form that is when the user clicks on Contact Us types

the name email and the message to us.

The third tab is called callback requests.

We get a callback request when the user leaves a phone number and clicks on the button call me.

For instance the user types the number 10 times 1 and clicks on call me as the feedback the user sees

the message that we're going to call them back as soon as possible and in the tab callback requests

we're going to see this request.

Of course when we have already called back we can delete the request.
